# Landing_Layout--Practice
<h2>Hello everyone!</h2>  <br>
<p>This project is website layout that I used to practice my skills in HTML, CCS and JS. <br>
The layout itself is Figma free resource: 
  <ul>
     <li><a href="https://www.figma.com/file/I7saRAs2RpOQiTen034b2I/Course-Success---simple%C2%A0website-template%C2%A0for-beginners-for-course-(Community)?type=design&node-id=0-3&mode=design&t=UmiyqDWIKTbpdWS7-0" target="_blank">Course-Success---simple-website-template</a></li>
  </ul>
Because it's that type of project where you need to create a responsive website, I'm sure is isn't good enough. <br>
I tried to use all knowledge, not without help of big brother and did my best for first website. <br>
