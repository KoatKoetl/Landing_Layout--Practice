# Landing_Layout--Practice
<h2>Hello everyone!</h2>  <br>
<p>This project is website layout that I used to practice my skills in HTML, CCS and JS. <br>
The layout itself is Figma free resource: 
  <ul>
     <li><a href="">Course-Success---simple-website-template</a></li>
  </ul>
Because it's that type of project where you need to create a responsive website, I'm sure is isn't good enough. <br>
I tried to use all knowledge, not without help of big brother and did my best for first website. <br>
</p>  
<h2>What is used</h2>
<ul>
  <li>HTML5 (sort of BEM method and sematic tags)</li>
  <li>CSS3</li>
  <li>JS</li>
  <li>Webpack5</li>
</ul>
